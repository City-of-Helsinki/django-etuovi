# django-etuovi
A Django wrapper around Etuovi API

## Code format

This project uses
[`black`](https://github.com/psf/black),
[`flake8`](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) and
[`isort`](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort)
for code formatting and quality checking. Project follows the basic
black config, without any modifications.

Basic `black` commands:

* To let `black` do its magic: `black .`
* To see which files `black` would change: `black --check .`
